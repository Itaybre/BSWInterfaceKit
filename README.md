# BSWInterfaceKit

This framework will allow you to build *better* iOS apps *faster* since it leverages battle tested classes for various common use cases in modern apps

##Playground
This also ships with a Playground so you can test the bundled classes easier. Just `cd` into the directory and `pod init`
