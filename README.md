# BSWInterfaceKit

This framework will allow you to build *better* iOS apps *faster* since it leverages battle tested classes for various common use cases in modern apps

##Playground
This also ships with a Playground so you can test the bundled classes easier. 
Make sure to also clone [BSWFoundation](https://github.com/BlurredSoftware/BSWFoundation) and put it in the same hierarchy before doing a `pod install` in the Playground directory.
